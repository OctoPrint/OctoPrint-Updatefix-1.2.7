            The "Updatefix 1.2.7" Plugin is installed on your OctoPrint installation.
            You should now be able to update to OctoPrint 1.2.8 without issues.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please note that the "Updatefix 1.2.7" plugin will <strong>uninstall itself</strong>
            once it detects that you have 1.2.8 installed. In order to uninstall itself, a
            restart of the OctoPrint server will be necessary. That means that you will see
            <strong>two restarts of OctoPrint</strong> during your update from 1.2.7
            to 1.2.8: One for the update to 1.2.8, one for the uninstall of the plugin.
        </p>
        <p>
            OctoPrint will show you a "Please Reload" dialog in the middle of these two
            restarts. <strong>Do not reload then</strong>. The background of the reload dialog will become
            darker during the second restart (the "Server Offline" overlay will pop up beneath
            the "Please Reload" overlay, another bug fixed in 1.2.8). Once it turns
            lighter again, you may reload.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you reload while the server is still starting, you will get a connection
            error, since your browser will not be able to connect to the OctoPrint server
            while it is still starting. In that case <strong>just wait a few minutes</strong>
            and then reload your browser tab manually.
